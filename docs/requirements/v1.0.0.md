## Game Play

Player plays on a square game board which contains a number of tiles.

- Game board may have different sizes, from the smallest 3 * 3 (9 tiles), to the biggest 8 * 8 (64 tiles).
- Player lands on the main menu at the beginning to choose which board he/she wants to play.
- Player can pick from a set of 6 buttons: 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, 6×6, 7×7, 8×8.
- Each tile has a number displayed at the center of the tile.
    - The number will start from 1, to the number of the total tiles (e.g. for 3 * 3 board, the number will be from 1 to 9).
    - The number will be randomly placed across the board.
- Each tile has a color border. The color will be picked from a pool of preset colors:
    - #EF4444 (red), #F97316 (orange), #EAB308 (yellow), #22C55E (green), #14B8A6 (teal), #3B82F6 (blue), #8B5CF6 (violet), #EC4899 (pink), #6B7280 (gray), #000000 (black)
- Each tile has a small gap among each other.
- Player needs to tap or click the tiles in the correct sequence based on the number assigned to the tiles.
    - On tile clicked or tapped, the background color should change slightly to indicate a clicked or tapped.
- Player picks a game board size at the beginning.
    - Once a board is selected, a countdown from 3 should begin. Player should get ready for the game play.
    - During countdown, the entire board should NOT be visible.
    - Once the countdown finishes, the selected board should be presented to the player, with all the numbers already assigned to each tile.
    - Together with the board, a timer should also be presented on the UI, which tells player how long the game has been past.
    - Together with the board, a group of heart icons should be presented on the UI to indicate how many failures player has made. For example, if player is allowed to have total 3 failures, 3 heart icons should be displayed with solid red color. If one failure occurs, a heart icon should have only border color in red (no longer having solid color).
- Player starts tapping or clicking the tiles in the number sequence.
    - If player taps or clicks a wrong tile, it counts one failure. Additionally, 2 seconds will be added to the timer.
        - The board border should flash red briefly (1-2 times) as feedback for wrong click.
        - When player reaches the maximum-allowed failures (default to 3) before finishing the game, game is over.
        - If game is over, a dialog with a message should be displayed in the center of the screen. Player can only interact with the dialog.
            - A button should also be on the dialog which on-clicked will take the player back to the main menu.
    - If player taps or clicks the correct tile in sequence, the tile should stay (number remains visible), and the player should continue looking for next tile with the correct sequence until all tiles have been tapped or clicked.
        - If player successfully clicks or taps all tiles in the correct sequence, a dialog with a congrats message should be displayed in the center of the screen. Player can only interact with the dialog.
            - A button should be on the dialog as well which on-clicked will take the player back to the main menu.

## Technical Requirements

- The game should work on both desktop and mobile devices with touch-friendly tile sizes.
- Responsive design to accommodate different screen sizes.
